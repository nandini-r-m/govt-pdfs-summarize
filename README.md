# govt-pdfs-summarize
**PDF Text Summarization and Q&A Pipeline**

This project is designed to process text from a PDF document by extracting, summarizing, and answering questions based on its content. It leverages various natural language processing (NLP) techniques and libraries, including NLTK, Gensim, and Hugging Face Transformers.

Features
PDF Text Extraction: Extracts text from a PDF file for further processing.
Text Preprocessing: Cleans and tokenizes text by removing stopwords and punctuation.
Text Summarization: Summarizes large pieces of text into concise, informative sections.
Word Embedding Training: Trains word embeddings on the processed text to understand word relationships.
Question Answering: Answers specific questions about the document using a pretrained NLP model.
Workflow
Text Extraction: The text is extracted from the input PDF file.

Preprocessing:

Converts the text into lowercase.
Removes unnecessary stopwords (like "and", "the", etc.).
Strips punctuation and organizes the words into sentences for further analysis.
Summarization:

Splits the text into smaller chunks to manage large document sizes.
Summarizes each chunk using a transformer-based NLP model, producing a concise version of the content.
Word Embedding Training:

After preprocessing, word embeddings (word vectors) are trained on the sentences using a neural network to represent words in a meaningful way.
Question Answering:

A question-answering model is employed to answer questions about the document. The model takes both the text of the document and the question, returning relevant answers based on the content.
Requirements
To run the project, you will need to install the following libraries:

NLTK: For text preprocessing and stopword removal.
Gensim: To train word embeddings using Word2Vec.
Transformers: To use pretrained models for text summarization and question answering.

Install the necessary dependencies using Python's package manager pip.

You will also need to download the NLTK stopwords dataset.

Text Preprocessing: The text from the PDF is preprocessed to remove noise like stopwords and punctuation.

Text Summarization: Large blocks of text are summarized into shorter, more readable paragraphs.

Word Embedding Training: The preprocessed text is used to train word embeddings, helping to understand word relationships.

Question Answering: You can ask questions about the content, and the system will generate relevant answers based on the document.

Example Questions
"What is written in the draft?"
"What are the amendments?"
"What is the date of publication?"
Purpose
This project is particularly useful for automatically processing large documents such as reports, research papers, or legal drafts. It enables users to quickly grasp the key points of the document and answer specific queries without reading through the entire text.

Future Enhancements
Potential future improvements include:

Enhancing the question-answering model for more complex questions.
Integrating more advanced PDF parsing methods for better text extraction.
Improving summarization by fine-tuning on domain-specific datasets.
